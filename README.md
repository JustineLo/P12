# P12 Frontend Dashboard

Welcome to the P12 Frontend Dashboard repository! This project is a frontend web application built with React, designed to work alongside the [P9 Backend Server](https://github.com/JustineLo/P9-front-end-dashboard). In this README, you'll find instructions on how to set up the prerequisites, install, and run the application.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (v2.x or later)

Additionally, you will need to set up and run the [P9 Backend Server](https://github.com/JustineLo/P9-front-end-dashboard) before you can launch the P12 Frontend Dashboard.
